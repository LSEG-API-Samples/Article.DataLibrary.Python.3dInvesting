# [3D Investing With Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/3d-investing-with-python)
Traditional mean-variance portfolio optimization often considers only 2 investing objectives which are risk and return (2D). 3D investing, on the other hand, adds sustainability as an additional objective to optimize risk and return, as well as sustainability objectives.

## Pre-requisites:
- LSEG Workspace application with an access for RD library desktop session, or RDP account for platform session
- Python 3.9 or above
- Python libraries
  - pandas==2.1.4
  - numpy==1.25.0
  - refinitiv-data==1.6.0
  - scipy==1.9.3
  - matplotlib==3.8.0
  - matplotlib-inline==0.1.6
  - plotly==5.22.0

## Conclusion
The 3D framework is a valuable tool for investors seeking to integrate sustainability into their portfolio construction while maintaining financial objectives. By utilizing the 3D investing framework, investors can construct portfolios that meet specific sustainability targets (e.g., carbon footprint reduction) without sacrificing returns or incurring excessive costs.
